  "`clojure -M:tiling` — is `traversal/tile-plan`'s tile the fast one?

  The plan picks a tile that *fits* a named cache level. Fitting and being
  fastest are different claims, and after the roofline result the default
  assumption has to be that a model may be arithmetically right about bytes
  while answering a question the machine does not ask.

  So this sweeps tile widths with loop order and everything else held fixed,
  marks where the plan pointed, and puts the best tile against the unblocked
  arm through `perfgate`. The verdict is gated on the points, not read off the
  means — the mistake the scaling CLI made first time round."
