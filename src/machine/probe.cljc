  "Reading a real machine and handing back a `machine.core` descriptor.

  `machine` is a contract and declares `:must-not [:probe-hardware]`, because
  a contract that performs effects is not a contract. This is the other half:
  the part that runs `sysctl`, parses `/sys/devices/system/cpu`, and stamps
  what it found as `:measured` with the command it read.

  The parsing is pure and the effect is a single injected function, so every
  platform's parser is testable against captured output without a device —
  which matters, because the interesting failures here are parse failures on
  a machine nobody has in the room.

  **It never fills a gap it did not read.** macOS does not expose cache
  associativity through `sysctl` at all, so `:ways` is simply absent from the
  descriptor rather than filled with the 8 that most caches happen to use.
  `machine.core` was changed to make `:ways` optional the day this probe was
  written, which is the correct direction: the contract bends to the machine,
  not the reading to the contract.

  Pure `.cljc` except for the injected reader. Depends only on
  `kotoba-lang/machine`."
