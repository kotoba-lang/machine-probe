  "Running a measurement on the machine the probe just described.

  The other half of the same host effect. `machine.probe` reads the static
  facts; this runs the dynamic ones. Both exist because `machine` is a
  contract that may not probe and `perfgate` is an assurance layer that may
  not benchmark — somebody has to actually touch the device, and it is this
  namespace, in one place, on purpose.

  The point is not to produce a fast number. It is to close the loop:
  `layout` *predicts* a cache-line count from a descriptor, this *measures*
  wall time on the machine that descriptor describes, and `perfgate` decides
  whether the difference survives the noise. A prediction nobody checked
  against a device is the thing this whole stack was built to stop shipping.

  JVM-only, and honest about that: the JIT, the GC and a laptop's thermal
  governor are all in the measurement. Warmup runs before samples, samples are
  reported raw, and `perfgate` is what decides whether they mean anything."
