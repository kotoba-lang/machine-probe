  "`clojure -M:calibrate` — measure the roofline's constants, then test it.

  `layout/achievable-ratio` was reported as agreeing with measurement twice on
  2026-08-03. Neither agreement meant anything: the loop floor came from the
  candidate arm and the bandwidth from the baseline arm, so the formula
  returned their ratio by construction. This is the test that was owed.

  Three steps, in an order that matters:

  1. measure the loop floor on an L1-resident array, where memory is free;
  2. measure the bandwidth on a line-strided scan of a 45 MiB array, where the
     loop is amortised over a whole cache line per touch;
  3. **predict a configuration neither measurement touched**, then run it.

  Step 3 is the only part that can fail. Steps 1 and 2 use array sizes, strides
  and element widths that step 3 does not, so the constants cannot encode the
  answer.

  It did fail, first time, by 65% — and the failure was step 2's fault, not the
  model's. Bandwidth was measured with a contiguous f64 sum, whose iteration
  touches 8 bytes and costs 0.77 ns, capping it at 10.4 GB/s: the loop floor
  wearing different units. The strided scan puts the memory system back in
  charge and reports 30.1 GB/s, and the prediction then lands within 19%.

  A prediction that misses is the useful outcome either way — it is either the
  model that is wrong or the calibration, and both are worth knowing."
