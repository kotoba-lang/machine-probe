  "`clojure -M:scaling` — does the AoS/SoA gap widen when cores compete for memory?

  The single-threaded run measured 2.02x against a predicted 16x. This tests
  the obvious explanation: one core cannot ask for enough bandwidth to make
  bandwidth the bottleneck. If that is right, the ratio climbs with thread
  count. If it stays flat, the explanation was wrong and has to be discarded
  rather than argued around — so the output prints the curve either way, and
  every point goes through `perfgate` on its own."
