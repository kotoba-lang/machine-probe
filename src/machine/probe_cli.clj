  "`clojure -M:probe` — read this machine and print its descriptor as EDN.

  JVM-only and deliberately thin: the shell-out is the entire host effect, and
  everything it hands to `machine.probe` is a string. That is what keeps the
  parsers testable against captured output on machines nobody has in the room."
