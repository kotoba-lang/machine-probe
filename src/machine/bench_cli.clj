  "`clojure -M:bench` — probe this machine, measure on it, and let the gate rule.

  The whole stack in one command: read the hardware, ask `layout` what it
  predicts, run the two loops, hand both arms to `perfgate`, print the verdict
  and the prediction error. Every step refuses to guess, so if any of them
  cannot answer the command says so instead of printing a number."
