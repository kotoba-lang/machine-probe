  "`clojure -M:unrolled` — make the loop cheap enough for memory to be visible.

  Three experiments in this repo have now failed for the same reason: the
  per-element loop cost dwarfs the per-element memory cost, so no layout and
  no tile can move the total. That is not a property of the machine, it is a
  property of a summation loop that runs at floating-point add *latency*
  because every add waits on the previous one.

  Four independent accumulators break the chain. This measures what that buys,
  and — the part that matters — whether it moves the AoS/SoA ratio toward the
  16x the byte model predicts. If it does, the models become testable here. If
  it does not, the next lever is a cheaper runtime, not a cheaper loop."
