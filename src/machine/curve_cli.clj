  "`clojure -M:curve` — measure this machine's bandwidth curve.

  Prints it in the shape `machine.core`'s `:bandwidth` section takes, so the
  output can go straight into a descriptor. The point of the curve rather than
  a point is that two planners were handed a single bandwidth number this
  afternoon and both were wrong: the spread across strides on one machine is
  about 3x."
