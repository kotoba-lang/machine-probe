  "`clojure -M:tlb` — measure this machine's address-translation penalty.

  `machine` could validate a `:tlb` fact and `traversal` could consume one,
  but nothing could produce one, so the numbers in both were hand-copied from
  a session transcript. That is the same 'declared but unfillable' state the
  fact itself was added to fix. This closes it: the output is a `:tlb` map
  that goes straight into a descriptor, and the last thing this prints is
  whether `machine/valid?` accepts the descriptor it just built."
