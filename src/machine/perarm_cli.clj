  "`clojure -M:perarm` — does per-arm bandwidth lookup actually predict better?

  layout 0.5.0 reads the machine's bandwidth curve at each arm's own stride
  rather than taking one figure for both. The claim was that this fixes the
  class of error that broke two models. **The claim was made without being
  measured**, which is the thing this whole ADR has been correcting all day.

  So: one configuration, two predictions, one measurement.

  - **old** — a single bandwidth constant shared by both arms, which is what
    the API allowed before and still allows via an explicit figure.
  - **new** — the curve read at each arm's stride.

  If the new one is not closer to the measurement, the change bought nothing
  and should be said so."
