  "Does the T5 contract actually compose?

  Every library here has its own tests against its own fixture. None of them
  answers the question this namespace exists for: hand ONE descriptor to all
  seven and do they agree, or does each quietly assume a different machine?

  That is not hypothetical. The seven consumers were found pinned to three
  different revisions of `machine` at once, so a correction landed in the
  contract reached none of them. Version drift is caught by a pin audit;
  SEMANTIC drift -- two libraries reading the same fact and meaning different
  things by it -- is only caught by making them share one.

  Deterministic throughout. No timing, so this says the same thing on a
  machine at load 84 as on an idle one, which is what let it be written at
  all today."
